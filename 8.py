''' Conditional Statements in Python: if, elif, and else
    if-----> The if statement is used to test a condition. If the condition is True, the block of code under the if statement is executed.
    elif---> The else statement provides an alternative block of code to execute when the if condition is False
    else---> The elif statement checks another condition if the previous if or elif condition was False
